# WES BOS

So I was hanging out with my friend [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/) at [JSConf](http://2013.jsconf.us/) recently. And for some reason, every time I said his name, I added an extra random syllable to both his first and last names. Because it was really the funnest thing. Ever.

For example, "Weston Bosley." Or "Westwood Boswitch." Or "Wesbee Bosshog."

Well, naturally, I had to create a website to celebrate this.

If you have suggestions for more [first and last name suffixes](https://github.com/cowboy/wesbos/blob/gh-pages/wesbos.js#L10-L13), file a PR and I'll add them in. Just make sure they actually sound cool. Thanks!
